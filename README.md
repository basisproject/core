# Basis core

This project holds the core datastructures, algorithms, and logic for the Basis
system. The goal is to implement as much as Basis as possible without worrying
about storage, networking, consensus, etc. This exists as a functionally-pure
library that drives Basis without concerning itself about all the other silly
details.
