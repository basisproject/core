//! Transactions are the primary interface for interacting with the Basis
//! system. They are responsible for taking the needed information (which must
//! be passed in) and returning a list of modifications that the caller is
//! responsible for applying to whatever storage medium they are using.
//!
//! The high-level picture here is that we're creating a functional API for the
//! models within the system and the interactions between them. The logic all
//! lives in the transactions (and in some cases the models) but storage happens
//! somewhere else and we don't touch it here.
//!
//! This means that any storage system that *can* support the Basis data models
//! could (in theory) be used without needing to couple any of the logic to the
//! storage mechanism.
