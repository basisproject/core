//! A company is a group of one or more people working towards a common economic
//! goal. Companies are the place where costs are accumulated and dispersed into
//! outgoing products and services.
//!
//! Companies have their own set of permissions that allow [Members] to perform
//! actions on the company. Note that while the [access system][access] uses
//! roles to contain various permissions, companies assign permissions directly.
//! This ultimately gives more control to companies to determine their own roles
//! (outside the perview of this library) as needed.
