//! A member is a link between an agent (a user or a company) to a parent
//! company. This link can carry other information, such occupation or
//! compensation in the case of a worker member. All memberships grant ownership
//! of the parent company, and this ownership is exercised by *individual*
//! members.
//!
//! Members have classes which describe the membership:
//!
//! - `Company` - Describes a company that is a member of another company. This
//! membership might come with certain privileges, such as usage of resources
//! in the larger company. When a smaller company becomes a members of a larger
//! company, the smaller company's members also become implicit members, and
//! become part owners of the parent company.
//! - `User` - An individual user who is a member of a company.
//! - `Worker` - An individual who works at the parent company, making widgets
//! or growing vegetables or any other productive role. Workers are the only
//! members that can perform [work transactions][1] (via a [Process][0]) for a
//! company, which assign costs to companies and print and transfer credits to
//! the worker's preferred account.
//!
