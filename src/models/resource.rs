//! A resource is a tangible asset. This can be anything, like a chair, a car,
//! a coat, or a carrot. It does not necessarily have to start with a "c". When
//! trying to understand resources, it's important to note that a resource is an
//! instance of a *resource specification*. When you look at a chair on Wamazon,
//! the page describes a resource specification. When the chair is shipped to
//! you, what you get is a resource (a manifestation of the chair specification).
