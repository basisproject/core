//! Models are the "atom" datatypes for Basis. They represent the objects in the
//! system and their relationships to each other (via IDs). Each model has a
//! struct (ie `User`) and an ID object (ie `UserID`). The id object allows
//! models to link to each other without having to embed the graph into the
//! model data itself.
//!
//! Models are read-only and can only be created or updated using
//! [transactions].
//!
//! In some cases models contain business logic (like [Event]) that define
//! various interactions. For the most part though, models define data structure
//! and relationships.
//!
//! This module also contains some utilities for enumerating changes to models
//! (like [Modifications]) and the classes that support them.
//!
//! Note that because this crate relies heavily on the [ValueFlows ontology][vf]
//! that many of the models have an `inner` field which represents the
//! corresponding ValueFlows type associated with the model. Composition is used
//! as the default pattern here, which offers a fairly clean implementation but
//! with the small sacrifice of having to sometimes to `model.inner().val()`
//! instead of just `model.val()`. The tradeoff is that the VF types are cleanly
//! separated from the Basis models.
//!
